                Hi There, I'm Liam! Ever since I grew up obsessed with computers, I knew a career in creating software was my dream! I remember having an old box computer at the age of 7 and connecting a webcam to it which opened up new a realm of opportunity in playing interactive games. This foundation began my obsession with technology and from there I moved onto "Scratch" in my primary days and eventually "PyGame" in highschool. These experiences helped me grow my foundations which helped me build a good knowledge with powerful engines such as "Unity Engine" and "Unreal Engine" in university. Once I had completed university, I decided to learn something else. This is where I began my journey in front-end web development.
